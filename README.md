Project Phase1
This is my Phase1 Project.
The technologies used include: HTML. CSS, and Javascript.
The HTML is used to give structure and body of the work, then the CSS was to beautify it, and the Javascript allows functionality.
The project features a tours and tour guides website.
The app allows users to book tours and /or tour guides to featured destinations they would like.
If a user puts destinations that is currently not featured, they are told to try another one. 
The app allows them to give their reviews on how the trip went, as well as how they were treated by the tour guides if they used any. 
the db.json file was created by me.
The reviews and bookings by users data is stored in the db.json for me to see. Reviews are displayed under the featured destination cards. 
When the user books a tour, they are able to see the price for the trip before confirming.
The price they see is readonly, so users cannot change.
