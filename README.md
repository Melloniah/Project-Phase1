Project Phase1
This is my Phase1 Project.
The technologies used include: HTML. CSS, and Javascript.
The HTML is used to give structure and body of the work, then the CSS was to beautify it, and the Javascript allows functionality.
For the backend, I have created a db.json server that i am using to fetch data from.
The db.json file contains the places to visit, the bookings people do, reviews, and the admin.
For the version control, this project uses Git and Github
The project features a tours and tour guides website.
The app allows users to book tours and /or tour guides to featured destinations they would like.
If a user puts destinations that is currently not featured, they are told to try another one. 
The app allows them to give their reviews on how the trip went, as well as how they were treated by the tour guides if they used any. 
the db.json file was created by me.
The reviews and bookings by users data is stored in the db.json for me to see. Reviews are displayed under the featured destination cards. 
When the user books a tour, they are able to see the price for the trip before confirming.
The price they see is readonly, so users cannot change.
As the admin, i can add, delete and update the user/travellers info
As the admin i can also see the number of travellers who have booked , travel dates and their destinations.
The user can know the price of the destination they have put before the confirm booking.

The user can whatsapp me from the footer contact section
This app most of the things, eg contact form, searching places in real time needed a solid backend. I look forward to adding some backend to it.
